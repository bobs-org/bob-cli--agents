#gh:gh_bobs-org__bob-cli You are researcher cld in a 5-researcher swarm. The other
researchers, `research.3c.cdx`, `research.3c.grk`, `research.3c.mus`, `research.3c.gem`,
are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named
reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__grk.md` and `__mus.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report
will end in `__cld.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

We already support the `offclock` boolean area note / project note file frontmatter
field to specify that all tasks in an area/project, recursively, should be treated as
offclock. I would now like to add support for a new `offclock_types` property that takes
a list of task type names as values.

- This field should work just like `offclock`, but only tasks which have one of the
  types listed by this field should be treated as offclock.
- As our first use-case I would like to migrate the area notes in my Obsidian vault that
  currently use `offclock` to start using `offclock_types` instead, with MEET being the
  only task type that they filter for.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.
