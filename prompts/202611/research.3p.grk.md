#gh:gh_bobs-org__bob-cli You are researcher grk in a 5-researcher swarm. The other
researchers, `research.3p.cdx`, `research.3p.cld`, `research.3p.mus`, `research.3p.gem`,
are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named
reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__cld.md` and `__mus.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report
will end in `__grk.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I would like to add generalized capture support for note files that use custom-defined
types.

- The ~/bob/eat/ files are examples of these types of files and should be our first
  use-case.
- I think we might have some other types that should be defined as well, but I might be
  wrong about this (podcasts, tv shows, and movies come to mind). You should think hard
  about this.
- Each one of these custom types should be able to define which frontmatter fields must
  be defined for each note defined of that type.
- Each custom type should also be associated with its own directory (like the ~/bob/eat/
  directory, for example).
- I'm not sure what the best capture syntax for this looks like (so you should think
  hard about this) but, when a capture specifies that a new note file of a
  custom-defined type should be added, then we should make it as easy as possible for
  the user to input the correct values for each required field (I'll let you decide if
  optional fields should be supported).

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.
