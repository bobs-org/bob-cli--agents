You are researcher cdx in a 5-researcher swarm. The other researchers,
`research.4i.cld`, `research.4i.grk`, `research.4i.mus`, `research.4i.gem`, are
independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named reports
ending in `__cld.md` and `__grk.md` and `__mus.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report will end
in `__cdx.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I would like to improve the way that we track my bank transactions.

- See the bob-cli-kd epic bead for context on the current functionality.
- When we close a bank row using the `<ctrl+enter>` keymap, we should automatically jump
  to the next unticked bank row.
- We should add a good link to the daily bank task (in the ~/bob/gtd_daily.md file) that
  takes me to the appropriate WellsFargo URL.
- We should change this task so it recurs weekly instead of daily (there is too much
  toil involved in downloading the QFX file to justify doing this daily).
- We should start supporting a user-configured list of transaction categories (it seems
  like we already support categories partially?).
  - You should dig through the transactions I imported yesterday (via the
    `bob bank import` command on my macbook) in order to identify appropriate categories
    for me personally. Don't expose details of my personal life in this research though.
  - When a bank row is closed via the `<ctrl+enter>` keymap, the user should be prompted
    to select a category, which they should be able to do with a single keypress.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.
