#gh:gh_bobs-org__bob-cli You are researcher cld in a 5-researcher swarm. The other
researchers, `research.5n.cdx`, `research.5n.grk`, `research.5n.mus`, `research.5n.gem`,
are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named
reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__grk.md` and `__mus.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report
will end in `__cld.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I want to start making it much clearer (in a visually appealing way) why a task is
blocked in Obsidian.

- I think the best way to do this is probably to start rendering `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`,
  and `[4]` for tasks that have a `priority` property using distinct colors for each
  priority.
- This means that we should probably stop rendering the priority icon I'm thinking,
  right?
- We could also start rendering `[&]` for tasks that are blocked by other tasks (i.e.
  have open task dependencies).
- Note that `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[4]`, and `[&]` are only suggestions (ones that I have
  low confidence in). Think hard about the best way to achieve my goal here.
- This way the only tasks that look like they use `[?]` in Obsidian are tasks that were
  explicitly scheduled using the `scheduled` task property.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.
