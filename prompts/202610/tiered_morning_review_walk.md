We recently seeded the `fresh` property for all ready Obsidian tasks with fake freshness
dates in order to chunk these up a bit so I am not overwhelmed. I don't think we'll need
to do that anymore if we refine my morning GTD review process a bit more.

- Namely, the `[s` / `]s` and `<ctrl+alt+j/k>` keymaps should always walk through new
  tasks first, then pending tasks, then next tasks, and then ready tasks in order based
  on which ready tasks have the lowest refresh interval and then (if refresh intervals
  are equal) based on which was refreshed earlier (i.e. is more overdue) and then (if
  they have the same `refresh` property value) based on which was created later. For
  example, we should review a task with a 1d refresh interval before we review a task
  with a 7d refresh interval that is 1d overdue but we should review a task with a 7d
  interval that is 3d overdue before that one and we should review a task with a 7d
  interval that is 3d overdue but was created a few days later even sooner .
- We should also change the way refresh intervals are determined by adding new
  configuration fields that control the refresh interval used for pending/next tasks.
  Also, any task that has a `scheduled` property should have a default refresh interval
  that is configurable as well. All of these should default to 1 (i.e. they need to be
  refreshed every day--in the case of scheduled tasks, this just means they need to be
  refreshed on the day they are due).
- This should have the effect of me always reviewing my new tasks, pending tasks, next
  tasks, due scheduled tasks, and other ready tasks in that order.
- Once that is done, we should remove all of the artificial `refresh` properties that we
  added previously.
- Review the tiered_morning_review_walk.md file in the research sidecar repo for context
  and inspiration before planning. I agree with all of the recommendations made by that
  research file.
- I want you to lead the design on this one. Make sure you design this feature so it is
  intuitive, reliable, and (last but not least) beautiful!

Can you help me implement this? Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using
your `/sase_plan` skill. Choose and author the appropriate tier, validate and revalidate
until it passes, then submit it with `sase plan propose` (as the skill instructs) before
making any file changes.
