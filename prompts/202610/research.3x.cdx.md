You are researcher cdx in a 5-researcher swarm. The other researchers,
`research.3x.cld`, `research.3x.grk`, `research.3x.mus`, `research.3x.gem`, are
independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named reports
ending in `__cld.md` and `__grk.md` and `__mus.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report will end
in `__cdx.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I would like to improve the way that the `bob ref create` command renders PDFs from
markdown files.

- Namely, I would like to add support for backlinks that make it very easy for the user
  reading the PDF to use local links to jump to a part of a document and then jump back
  to where they were originally.
- I think we can accomplish this by searching for any local links in the markdown,
  figuring out which part of the document they link to, adding a unique alphanumeric ID
  to the rendered local link text, and then adding a new local link at the original
  link's target destination that uses that same alphanumeric ID as rendered link text
  but links back to the original link.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.
