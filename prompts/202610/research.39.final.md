%clan(research.39, tribe=research, summary=[[[bold]RESEARCH PROMPT:[/bold] One of my
goals while reviewing my Obsidian tasks during my morning GTD is to make sure that no
area/project note file contains more than N ready tasks (this number should be
configurable, but should default to 5).

- The idea is that if I have more than N ready tasks in a area/project, then I should
  probably look into creating a new project from some of those tasks and/or
  de-prioritizing (using the `<ctrl+shift+p>` keymap, for example) some tasks in that
  area/project note file.
- I would like to make it clearer which project files have more ready tasks than they
  should.
- We should show some kind of notification / toast in Obsidian anytime we use any one of
  the Obsidian keymaps that would cause this constraint to be violated (for example,
  when moving a task to a project note file that already has >=N ready tasks).
- We should show a badge and/or diagnostics in the ~/bob/dash.md file and/or in project
  note files that makes it clear how many area/projects violate this contraint currently
  (and which ones).
- I should also have the ability to view this information from the command-line. Namely,
  I should have the ability to review the number of ready tasks in each area/project
  note file from the command-line and should be able to see (in some visually appealing
  way) when this constraint is being violated (and in which area/project note files).

The researchers' registered reports:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}

- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }}
  path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }} {% endfor %}

Month directory (create it if missing):

$(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)

Steps:

1. From the registered reports above, identify exactly one report per expected suffix in
   cdx, cld, grk, mus, gem, belonging to this dispatch's `research.39.cdx`,
   `research.39.cld`, `research.39.grk`, `research.39.mus`, `research.39.gem`
   dependencies, matching by `wait_name` and the canonical research label's existing
   `__<suffix>.md` suffix. Never reassign suffixes from list order. Open the research
   repo with `/sase_repo`, then read each report through its canonical research
   reference (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has moved)
   using `sase artifact read`. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. If the records
   above do not identify exactly one report per expected suffix, stop and report the
   missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing.
2. Research the request yourself, prioritizing gaps, weak evidence, and disagreements
   between the reports.
3. Pick a descriptive stem `<name>` that collides with nothing in the month directory
   (do NOT end the name with `_consolidated` or `_<YYYYmmdd>` or anything similar unless
   it relates to the research topic), create `<month-dir>/<name>/`, and move each report
   inside it as `<name>__<suffix>.md`, preserving its existing suffix. Each report's
   `source_path` is provenance for where it lives in your own opened research checkout;
   resolve its canonical repo-relative path there before moving it. Never modify the
   other agents' checkouts or the stored snapshot recorded at `ref` — only the copy in
   your own checkout moves. Preserve every file and never overwrite: on any collision,
   pick a different stem first.
4. Write the consolidated report to `<name>/<name>__final.md`: merge the strongest
   findings from every report above and your own research, resolve conflicts, cut
   duplication, and add missing critical context without unnecessary length.

   Do not create `<name>/<name>.md`, not even as a placeholder, because the linker agent
   `research.39.linker` publishes it from your report.

5. After the write succeeds, register the consolidated report as a durable snapshot so
   the linker agent, `research.39.linker`, can find it:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l
   "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the consolidated report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the
   research repo root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>__final.md`. Register
   only the consolidated report, and do not pass `--move`. If registration fails, report
   that failure; do not report the task as fully complete.
