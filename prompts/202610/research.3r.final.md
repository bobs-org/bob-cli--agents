%clan(research.3r, tribe=research, summary=[[[bold]RESEARCH PROMPT:[/bold] I would like
to add a new `--listen` option to the `bob highlights create` command that uses the
`sase-listen render <target> -e full` command (see the sase-org/sase-listen repo on
GitHub) to create a new podcast episode (that gets published to a feed that I subscribe
to from the AntennaPod app on my phone) alongside the PDF and ref note that is linked to
from the PDF we generate.

- The goal of this change is to make sure that I am always tracking articles / papers
  that I listen to via AI audio transcriptions in my Obsidian ref note system.
- We should not depend directly on the `sase-listen` command, but should instead make
  this configurable (make the appropriate changes to my bob config, which is defined in
  my chezmoi repo).
- Also, as a part of this change, i want to make sure that the `bob highlights create`
  command supports the same values for `<target>` that the `sase-listen render` command
  does. Namely, it should support URLs that point to PDFs. It should also have the same
  special support for arxiv that sase-listen does. When `<target>` points to a PDF, we
  obviously don't need to create a new PDF (just use that one), but make sure to add the
  appropriate Highlghts note and store it in the proper location still.
- The `sase-listen render` command's output should be shown in full if it is run by the
  `bob highlghts create` command.

The researchers' registered reports:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}

- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }}
  path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }} {% endfor %}

Month directory (create it if missing):

$(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)

Steps:

1. From the registered reports above, identify exactly one report per expected suffix in
   cdx, cld, grk, mus, gem, belonging to this dispatch's `research.3r.cdx`,
   `research.3r.cld`, `research.3r.grk`, `research.3r.mus`, `research.3r.gem`
   dependencies, matching by `wait_name` and the canonical research label's existing
   `__<suffix>.md` suffix. Never reassign suffixes from list order. Open the research
   repo with `/sase_repo`, then read each report through its canonical research
   reference (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has moved)
   using `sase artifact read`. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. If the records
   above do not identify exactly one report per expected suffix, stop and report the
   missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing.
2. Research the request yourself, prioritizing gaps, weak evidence, and disagreements
   between the reports.
3. Pick a descriptive stem `<name>` that collides with nothing in the month directory
   (do NOT end the name with `_consolidated` or `_<YYYYmmdd>` or anything similar unless
   it relates to the research topic), create `<month-dir>/<name>/`, and move each report
   inside it as `<name>__<suffix>.md`, preserving its existing suffix. Each report's
   `source_path` is provenance for where it lives in your own opened research checkout;
   resolve its canonical repo-relative path there before moving it. Never modify the
   other agents' checkouts or the stored snapshot recorded at `ref` — only the copy in
   your own checkout moves. Preserve every file and never overwrite: on any collision,
   pick a different stem first.
4. Write the consolidated report to `<name>/<name>__final.md`: merge the strongest
   findings from every report above and your own research, resolve conflicts, cut
   duplication, and add missing critical context without unnecessary length.

   Do not create `<name>/<name>.md`, not even as a placeholder, because the linker agent
   `research.3r.linker` publishes it from your report.

5. After the write succeeds, register the consolidated report as a durable snapshot so
   the linker agent, `research.3r.linker`, can find it:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l
   "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the consolidated report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the
   research repo root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>__final.md`. Register
   only the consolidated report, and do not pass `--move`. If registration fails, report
   that failure; do not report the task as fully complete.
