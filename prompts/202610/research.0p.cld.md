#gh:gh_bobs-org__bob-cli You are researcher cld in a 5-researcher swarm. The other
researchers, `research.0p.cdx`, `research.0p.grk`, `research.0p.mus`, `research.0p.gem`,
are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named
reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__grk.md` and `__mus.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report
will end in `__cld.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I would like to start automatically creating task links for tasks that depend on tasks
that we close in the current daily file.

- We should support this behavior when a task link's task is closed via the
  `<ctrl+enter>` keymap in Obsidian or via the `bob capture` command's `=x!` / `=!`
  syntax.
- We should display a good toast to the user in Obsidian or via the bob-mac-capture app
  (depending on how the task was closed) to let the user know which new task links were
  added and why.
- These task links should be added to the same pomodoro that the closed task was in or
  the newly created pomodoro if the entire pomodoro that the old task was in was closed.
- It is important that we are able to perform this operation quickly so this doesn't
  effect performance too much. The bob-mac-capture app, in particular, needs to remain
  blazing fast.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.
