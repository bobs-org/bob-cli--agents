to implement a sase memory web that records the more important architectural / policy
decisions that I've made for this project, the bob-plugins project, the bob-mac-capture
project, and my Obsidian vault in general.

  "sase" project.

  web.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.]])

#gh:gh_bobs-org__bob-cli You are the lead researcher: 5 independent researchers have
reported on the request below, and you will add your own research and merge every
perspective into one consolidated report.

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

Research request:

I think I want to implement a sase memory web that records the more important
architectural / policy decisions that I've made for this project, the bob-plugins
project, the bob-mac-capture project, and my Obsidian vault in general.

- This memory web should be heavily inspired by the decisions memory web defined in the
  "sase" project.
- Think hard about which initial decisions memory strands I should add to this memory
  web.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a

The researchers' registered reports:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}

- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }}
  path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }} {% endfor %}

Month directory (create it if missing):

$(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)

Steps:

1. From the registered reports above, identify exactly one report per expected suffix in
   cdx, cld, grk, mus, gem, belonging to this dispatch's `research.r.cdx`,
   `research.r.cld`, `research.r.grk`, `research.r.mus`, `research.r.gem` dependencies,
   matching by `wait_name` and the canonical research label's existing `__<suffix>.md`
   suffix. Never reassign suffixes from list order. Open the research repo with
   `/sase_repo`, then read each report through its canonical research reference (or the
   `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has moved) using
   `sase artifact read`. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. If the records above
   do not identify exactly one report per expected suffix, stop and report the missing
   or ambiguous input instead of guessing.
2. Research the request yourself, prioritizing gaps, weak evidence, and disagreements
   between the reports.
3. Pick a descriptive stem `<name>` that collides with nothing in the month directory
   (do NOT end the name with `_consolidated` or `_<YYYYmmdd>` or anything similar unless
   it relates to the research topic), create `<month-dir>/<name>/`, and move each report
   inside it as `<name>__<suffix>.md`, preserving its existing suffix. Each report's
   `source_path` is provenance for where it lives in your own opened research checkout;
   resolve its canonical repo-relative path there before moving it. Never modify the
   other agents' checkouts or the stored snapshot recorded at `ref` — only the copy in
   your own checkout moves. Preserve every file and never overwrite: on any collision,
   pick a different stem first.
4. Write the consolidated report to `<name>/<name>.md`: merge the strongest findings
   from every report above and your own research, resolve conflicts, cut duplication,
   and add missing critical context without unnecessary length.
