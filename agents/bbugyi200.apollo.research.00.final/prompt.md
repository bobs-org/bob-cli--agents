%clan(research.00, tribe=research, summary=[[[bold]RESEARCH PROMPT:[/bold] We
recently seeded the `fresh` property for all ready Obsidian tasks with fake freshness
dates in order to chunk these up a bit so I am not overwhelmed. I don't think we'll need
to do that anymore if we refine my morning GTD review process a bit more.

- Namely, the `[s` / `]s` and `<ctrl+alt+j/k>` keymaps should always walk through new
  tasks first, then pending tasks, then next tasks, and then ready tasks in order based
  on which ready tasks have the lowest refresh interval and then (if refresh intervals
  are equal) based on which was refreshed earlier (i.e. is more overdue) and then (if
  they have the same `refresh` property value) based on which was created later. For
  example, we should review a task with a 1d refresh interval before we review a task
  with a 7d refresh interval that is 1d overdue but we should review a task with a 7d
  interval that is 3d overdue before that one and we should review a task with a 7d
  interval that is 3d overdue but was created a few days later even sooner .
- We should also change the way refresh intervals are determined by adding new
  configuration fields that control the refresh interval used for pending/next tasks.
  Also, any task that has a `scheduled` property should have a default refresh interval
  that is configurable as well. All of these should default to 1 (i.e. they need to be
  refreshed every day--in the case of scheduled tasks, this just means they need to be
  refreshed on the day they are due).
- This should have the effect of me always reviewing my new tasks, pending tasks, next
  tasks, due scheduled tasks, and other ready tasks in that order.
- Once that is done, we should remove all of the artificial `refresh` properties that we
  added previously.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.]]) %id:research.00.final %m:@xlarge

consolidated report.

We

dates in order to chunk these up a bit so I am not overwhelmed. I don't think we'll need

The researchers' registered reports:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

Month directory (create it if missing):

$(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)

Steps:

1. From the registered reports above, identify exactly one report per expected suffix
   in cdx, cld, grk, mus, gem, belonging to this
   dispatch's `research.00.cdx`, `research.00.cld`, `research.00.grk`, `research.00.mus`, `research.00.gem` dependencies, matching by `wait_name` and the canonical research
   label's existing `__<suffix>.md` suffix. Never reassign suffixes from list order.
   Open the research repo with `/sase_repo`, then read each report through its canonical
   research reference (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has
   moved) using `sase artifact read`. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. If the
   records above do not identify exactly one report per expected suffix, stop and report
   the missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing.
2. Research the request yourself, prioritizing gaps, weak evidence, and disagreements
   between the reports.
3. Pick a descriptive stem `<name>` that collides with nothing in the month directory
   (do NOT end the name with `_consolidated` or `_<YYYYmmdd>` or anything similar unless
   it relates to the research topic), create `<month-dir>/<name>/`, and move each report
   inside it as `<name>__<suffix>.md`, preserving its existing suffix. Each report's
   `source_path` is provenance for where it lives in your own opened research checkout;
   resolve its canonical repo-relative path there before moving it. Never modify the
   other agents' checkouts or the stored snapshot recorded at `ref` — only the copy in
   your own checkout moves. Preserve every file and never overwrite: on any collision,
   pick a different stem first.
4. Write the consolidated report to `<name>/<name>__final.md`: merge the strongest findings
   from every report above and your own research, resolve conflicts, cut duplication,
   and add missing critical context without unnecessary length.

   Do not create `<name>/<name>.md`, not even as a placeholder, because the linker
   agent `research.00.linker` publishes it from your report.

5. After the write succeeds, register the consolidated report as a durable snapshot so
   the linker agent, `research.00.linker`, can find it:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the consolidated report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the
   research repo root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>__final.md`. Register
   only the consolidated report, and do not pass `--move`. If registration fails,
   report that failure; do not report the task as fully complete.
