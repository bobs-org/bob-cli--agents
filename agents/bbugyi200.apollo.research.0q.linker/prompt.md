You are the linker agent for a research swarm. The lead researcher,
`research.0q.final`, has written a consolidated report on the request below. Your job
is to publish that report as the canonical `<name>.md`: the file readers open, and the
one SASE renders into a Highlights PDF. You are an editor, not a researcher. The new
file must carry exactly the lead's meaning and intent. Do not do research of your own:
add no new claims or sources, settle no open questions, and neither soften nor
strengthen the conclusions or the recommendation. If the lead seems wrong, leave it as
written. The only prose you write yourself is the short research-query summary of the
request that opens the file (step 3).

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

Research request (context only; do not research it, but summarize it as the file's
research query in step 3):

I
would like to re-imagine the way that we track ref tasks.

- I have been treating ref tasks as normal Obsidian tasks in practice, but our
  implementation does not support this well or encourage it.
- Namely, the fact that we store ref tasks inside of ref notes is not intuitive or
  consistent with how we treat other tasks, which all live in either area notes or
  project notes.
- I would like to fix this by requiring that all future and currently open ref notes
  have a project note or area note listed as their parent.
- We should then be able to define the ref task for each ref associated with an
  area/project in the "Tasks" section of the corresponding note file like we do for all
  other Obsidian tasks.
- You should migrate any existing ref notes that are associated with open ref tasks to
  use this new policy and move their ref tasks to the appropriate area/project note
  file.
- This complicates syncing the ref note status with the ref task a bit since we need to
  account for the possibility that the ref task gets moved to a "done" note file in the
  ~/bob/done/ directory at some point.
- Also, I think there is a lot of logic that currently treats ref tasks as special /
  something to filter out. We don't show them when pressing `^` to show today's /
  pending / next tasks in the bob-mac-capture app, for example. Just about all (probably
  all, but think hard about this so we don't break any invariants that I currently rely
  on) of this logic should be removed so we start treating ref tasks like any other
  task.
- This change will also require that we start prompting the user for a project / area
  note file when capturing new ref URLs (via the bob-mac-capture app or the
  `bob gkeep pull` command, for example) so we know which project / area note file to
  use.
- This project / area name should then be passed to the `bob ref create` command's new,
  required `-p|--parent` option.
- I currently use a sase (a GitHub project in the sase-org organization) file hook that
  uses this `bob ref create` command. We will need to start passing in the project name
  (e.g. "sase", "bob-cli") to the `-p|--parent` option.
  - I'm not sure that sase injects the project name into this file hook command string
    right now, so you might need to add support for that.
  - Also note that it is not guaranteed that the project name that gets passed in will
    exactly match the project note's name. For example, the "bob-cli" project name
    should actually map to the ~/bob/bob.md file. To work around this, we should add
    support for a new `project_name_aliases` frontmatter field to project notes that
    allows them to specify alternative names that will be matched by the `bob` command
    when searching for a project by name. We should set this field to `["bob-cli"]` for
    the ~/bob/bob.md project note.
- We will need to start giving ref tasks a different block ID since `^ref` will no
  longer be guaranteed to be unique. In order to make ref tasks stand out a bit more, we
  should also start rendering an appropriate icon/symbol instead of `#ref` when these
  tasks are rendered in Obsidian.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.

The lead researcher's registered report:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

The image agent's registered images:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "image" %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} vcs_relpath={{ a.vcs_relpath }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}


Steps:

1. **Identify the source.** From the registered reports above, find exactly one entry
   with `wait_name` `research.0q.final` whose label has the form
   `research:<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>__final.md`. If there is not exactly one such entry,
   stop and report the missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing. Open the research
   repo with `/sase_repo`, then read the report through its canonical research reference
   (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has moved) using
   `sase artifact read`. Take `<YYYYMM>/<name>/` from the label, never from the current
   date. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. Never modify, move, or delete
   `<name>__final.md` or the drafts.

2. **Inventory what must survive.** Before writing, list every finding, recommendation,
   caveat, open question, confidence statement, number, date, version, code block,
   table, and link in the lead's report.
3. **Restructure** the lead's report into a well-thought-out organization:
   - Keep the frontmatter, updating `updated_time` if present.
   - **Open the file in this exact order**, with nothing else between these parts: the frontmatter (if any), one `#` title, the research query, the infographic, and then the bottom-line section.
   - **Research query.** Directly below the title, add one blockquote that summarizes
     the research request above in one to three sentences, for example
     `> **Research query:** <summary>`. Phrase it as the question or task being
     answered, in the requester's own terms: keep the questions, named subjects, and
     explicit scope or constraints; drop instructions aimed at agents, such as output
     paths, macro or directive syntax, and formatting requests. Summarize what was
     asked, not material the request quotes or attaches. Use a request that is already
     one short sentence verbatim. Never fold findings, answers, or scope the request
     does not state into it. It is not a heading, so it gets no section number and no
     TOC entry.
   - **Embed the infographic** exactly once, directly above the bottom-line section:
     after the research query and before that section's `##` heading, never further
     down. Use a relative link with descriptive alt text, for example
     `![<alt text>](<name>_infographic.png)`. Locate it by the
     `<name>_infographic.png` convention or the image entries above. Embed only a file
     you have confirmed exists beside the report in your research checkout. If the
     image agent completed without producing one, publish without it (the research query then sits directly above the bottom-line section) and say so in the final
     response.
   - **Bottom-line section.** The first `##` section is `## Bottom line` (or
     `## Overview` when the report surveys options rather than giving one answer) and
     gives the answer first.
   - Below it, `##` and `###` sections ordered by the questions a reader will ask, with
     duplicated passages merged.
   - **Never number headings.** The PDF renderer runs pandoc with `--number-sections`,
     so hand-numbered headings render doubly numbered.
   - **No table of contents and no block of jump links.** The PDF already gets a TOC.
   - Keep the lead's wording where it works. Never drop a claim, caveat, or source to
     save space. If the lead's report restates the question or lists its inputs, keep
     those details in a later section; the research query summarizes the request but
     does not replace them.
4. **Validate every link carried over.**
   - Relative links resolve from `<YYYYMM>/<name>/`, and in-document anchors resolve
     against the final headings. Both are hard requirements.
   - Check external URLs with `curl -fsSL -o /dev/null --max-time 20 <url>`, retrying
     a transient failure once. Treat 401, 403, 429, and timeouts as _unverified_ and
     keep those links.
   - Verify repository-file links through a `/sase_repo` checkout, not by fetching
     github.com.
   - Repair a link only when the right target is certain: a followed redirect, a moved
     file, an obvious typo, or a renamed heading. For an unrepairable link, keep its
     text, drop the dead URL, and list it in the final response. **Never search for a
     replacement source.**

5. **Add in-document links** so readers can jump between parts of the file. Add them
   inline and sparingly: from summary points to the sections that back them, from "see
   above" or "see below" phrases, and from mentions of a named option, phase, or
   finding to where it is discussed. Do not link every mention.
   - Every heading used as a link target must start with a letter, contain only
     letters, digits, spaces, and hyphens, and be unique. Its anchor is then the
     lowercased heading with spaces replaced by hyphens, for example
     `[the bottom line](#bottom-line)`. pandoc (the PDF) and GitHub then agree.
   - Move emoji, version numbers, and code out of such headings, into the section's
     first line.
   - When `pandoc` is available, confirm anchors with `pandoc <file> -t html`.

6. **Re-check against the step-2 inventory** and restore anything missing or changed.
   Every URL in `<name>__final.md` must appear in the new file unless it was listed as
   unrepairable. Then confirm the file opens in the step-3 order: title, research query, infographic, bottom-line section.

7. **Write** `<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>.md` without overwrite. On a collision, stop and
   report it.

8. **Register** it as a durable snapshot:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the research repo
   root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>.md`. Use no `--move`. If
   registration fails, report it and do not claim full completion.
