You are researcher cld in a 5-researcher swarm.
The other researchers, `research.48.cdx`, `research.48.grk`, `research.48.mus`, `research.48.gem`, are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__grk.md` and `__mus.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report will end in `__cld.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I
would like to start showing the current pomodoro (if any) and all future pomodoros in
the preview shown by the bob-mac-capture app when no input text has been typed.

- This preview should therefore load by default when the panel first pops up.
- Since we will load this preview so often, we should make sure to cache it somehow when
  the daily file's contents haven't changed at all. IMPORTANT: The bob-mac-capture app
  MUST be blazing fast.
- For each task associated with a task link in a current or future pomodoro in today's
  daily file, we should always show as much of each task's contents as possible without
  causing the user to need to scroll the preview pane.
- This means that, if it all fits in the preview pane without the user needing to scroll
  (we should expand the height of the window as neccessary), we shoould show the full
  task definition for each task including all of its sub-bullets.
- Otherwise, we should support two folded views, which we will use in this order of
  priority, if necessary, to decrease the size of the contents in the preview pane:
  1. A view of each task that does not show the work log or schedule log for that task,
     but shows all other sub-bullets.
  2. A single-line view of each task.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution. #research(suffix=cld)
