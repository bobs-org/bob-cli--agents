#gh:gh_bobs-org__bob-cli I would like to add support for the ability to target (i.e. copy) code block
contents from the copy mode that is activated from the bob-mac-capture app's ref panel
via the `<cmd+y>` keymap. Can you help me implement this?

- We will probably only be able to make this work for ref notes that were created by
  converting markdown files to PDFs (via the `bob ref create` command).
- We might need to start copying the markdown files that we used to generate the PDFs to
  some nearby location for this use-case (unless we can read the PDF directly). This is
  probably a good practice anyway so we always have access to the original markdown
  file.
- Think hard about what the best UX is for this is.
- As a part of this change, we should also add a new `<cmd+y>` keymap to the Highlights
  app that triggers the ref panel with copy mode activated for the current PDF.
- Review the ref_code_block_copy.md file in the research sidecar repo for context and inspiration
  before planning. I agree with all of the requirements recommended in that research
  file (but keep in mind that you are responsible for planning and splitting up this
  work appropriately).
