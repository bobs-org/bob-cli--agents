#gh:gh_bobs-org__bob-cli I want to implement a new `bob randomize` command. Can you help me implement
this?

- This command would be used to re-schedule all of the currently due scheduled and
  prioritized Obsidian tasks (i.e. tasks that have a `scheduled` property equal to a
  date of today or earlier and have a `priority` property) using a random date.
- I use the `priority` field to mark lower priority (<P0) tasks. The goal of this change
  is to allow me to quickly re-schedule all of these lower priority tasks using random
  dates at once. This will be useful, for example, when I've gone several days/weeks
  without reviewing my tasks and need to focus all of my attention on getting P0 tasks
  done / organized.
- Each task's date should be randomized separately using the range of dates that is
  configured in the ~/.config/bob/config.yml file (based on the priority of that task).
- If possible, we should try to commit the file changes made by this command using a
  single commit. Make sure that our single commit doesn't cause issues with / conflict
  with the `bob vault-sync` command.
- Review the bob_randomize_backlog_reroll.md file in the research sidecar repo for
  context and inspiration before planning.
