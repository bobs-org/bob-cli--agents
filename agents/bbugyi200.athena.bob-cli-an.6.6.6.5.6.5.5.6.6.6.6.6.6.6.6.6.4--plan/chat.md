## Prompt

Can you complete the work for bead bob-cli-an.6.6.6.5.6.5.5.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.4? The
bead is already reserved for you and assigned to your agent name: it was set to
status=in_progress before you started reading this, either by the `sase bead work` launch
checkpoint or by the runtime promoting an ad-hoc wait-time claim. Do not set the status
by hand. If the host notice says the bead was already closed when this run started, the
run is attached to the closed bead. Only the host notice tells you that; if `sase bead read` shows
a closed bead and no host notice said so, you copied the wrong ID — re-copy `bob-cli-an.6.6.6.5.6.5.5.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.4` from
this prompt before concluding anything. Check whether the earlier work landed before
redoing anything, and run `sase bead open bob-cli-an.6.6.6.5.6.5.5.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.4` only if the work is genuinely unfinished. Read its
description and design file with `sase bead read bob-cli-an.6.6.6.5.6.5.5.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.4 -r "Need the phase scope and design file"`, do the work, and close only this bead with
`sase bead close bob-cli-an.6.6.6.5.6.5.5.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.4 --note "<what you verified>"`. Honor the epic's DECISIONS shown by `sase bead read`; they are final, and only memory notes
they authorize may be edited. Before closing, run `sase bead epic-symbols bob-cli-an.6.6.6.5.6.5.5.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.4`. If this phase still has `--epic-symbol`
entries, resolve each symbol or re-key the Justfile line to a still-open bead (the
parent epic or a later phase). `sase bead close` refuses while leftovers remain; they go stale the
instant this phase closes and turn unrelated agents' `just check` red. Closing an assigned
phase bead is unaffected by the parent-close descendant guard. Do NOT close the parent
epic or any ancestor plan bead. Any instruction in a phase description or child plan to
close an ancestor is preparation and evidence for that ancestor's land agent, not
authorization for a phase worker. Do not create beads yourself: record discovered
follow-up work as a `PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP:` entry via `sase bead note bob-cli-an.6.6.6.5.6.5.5.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.4 'PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP: <one-line summary — detail>'`; the epic's land agent triages these into
task beads. A check failure that reproduces identically on the clean base tree does not
keep this bead open: record it as a `PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP:` entry (citing any task bead that already
tracks it) and close anyway; nothing relaunches a phase left open. Before planning,
check the phase's notes: if an earlier agent already worked this phase and left it open
with recorded remaining work, that remainder did not fit one agent, so author a child
epic whose phases each fit one coding agent and whose land agent closes this phase
instead of another single-agent tale unless one coder can clearly finish everything
left. Think this through thoroughly and create a plan using your `/sase_plan` skill. Choose
and author the appropriate tier, validate and revalidate until it passes, then submit it
with `sase plan propose` (as the skill instructs) before making any file changes.


## Response

I’ll read the phase scope and prior notes, check what has already landed, and use the `sase_plan` skill to submit a plan before changing files. I’ll also use the required SASE memory reader for the bead workflow.


The phase has no earlier work notes, and the scan still rejects the entire batch when one PDF has dirty targets. The approved decision is to hold that PDF and continue with clean ones. I’m tracing both output paths and the Mac app’s decoder to make the plan cover receipts, exit status, and Bob Refs ⌘S.


I’m using the `sase_repo` skill to inspect Bob Mac Capture’s scan consumer. The existing report already supports per-PDF holds, so this may fit the current JSON shape; the key check is whether the app accepts and displays a new hold reason.


The Mac app accepts arbitrary hold reasons, but its display currently ignores them unless they are one of three known reasons. The plan will add a visible “retrying next scan” message for dirty holds and test the ⌘S path. It will also classify dirty targets before any PDF writes, so shared destinations do not become false refusals partway through the scan.


The medium tale plan validates with no warnings. It covers per-PDF holds, success when every PDF is held, unchanged dirty-target protections, receipts, and Bob Refs ⌘S verification. I’m submitting the requested SASE plan handoff now; implementation and bead closure remain for the coding turn.
