No action is needed: editable installs build from the checkout regardless, and `tools/ratchet_core_pin` moves the published pin on the release branch at release time.
[setup] Note: the sase-core checkout is ahead of the published sase-core-rs pin in pyproject.toml; dev installs build from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/bobs-org/bob-cli/bob-cli_10/sase/repos/external/gh/sase-org/sase-core regardless. This is normal — the release-branch reconciler ratchets the published pin at release time, so no action is needed here.
