Can you complete the work for bead bob-cli-87.7? The bead is already reserved for you and assigned to your agent
name: it was set to status=in_progress before you started reading this, either by the `sase bead work` launch
checkpoint or by the runtime promoting an ad-hoc wait-time claim. Do not set the status by hand. Read its
description and design file with `sase bead read bob-cli-87.7 -r "Need the phase scope and design file"`, do the work, and close only this bead with
`sase bead close bob-cli-87.7 --note "<what you verified>"`. Honor the epic's DECISIONS shown by
`sase bead read`; they are final, and only memory notes they authorize may be edited. Before closing, run
`sase bead epic-symbols bob-cli-87.7`. If this phase still has `--epic-symbol` entries, resolve each symbol or
re-key the Justfile line to a still-open bead (the parent epic or a later phase). `sase bead close` refuses while
leftovers remain; they go stale the instant this phase closes and turn unrelated agents' `just check` red. Closing
an assigned phase bead is unaffected by the parent-close descendant guard. Do NOT close the parent epic or any ancestor plan bead. Any instruction in a phase
description or child plan to close an ancestor is preparation and evidence for that ancestor's land agent, not
authorization for a phase worker. Do not create beads yourself: record discovered follow-up work as a
`PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP:` entry via
`sase bead note bob-cli-87.7 'PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP: <one-line summary — detail>'`; the epic's land agent triages
these into task beads. A check failure that reproduces identically on the clean base tree does not keep this bead
open: record it as a `PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP:` entry (citing any task bead that already tracks it) and close anyway;
nothing relaunches a phase left open. Before planning, check the phase's notes: if an earlier agent already
worked this phase and left it open with recorded remaining work, that remainder did not fit one agent, so author
a child epic whose phases each fit one coding agent and whose land agent closes this phase instead of another
single-agent tale unless one coder can clearly finish everything left.
