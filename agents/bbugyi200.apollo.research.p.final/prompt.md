%clan(research.p, tribe=research, summary=[[[bold]RESEARCH PROMPT:[/bold] The way that I
track the work that I do each day in the "Pomodoros" section of my Obsidian daily files
(see the ~/bob/2026/20260929.md file, for example) is a bit chaotic and I feel like I
could do a better job of planning, but also want to keep my method simple (maybe even
simpler than what I do now, but more complexity is okay if it is warranted).

Review the pomodoro_ledger_and_daily_roadmap.md file in the research sidecar repo for
context and inspiration before performing your own research, but note the following
short-comings:

- It did not propose a solution to automate any of this and did not consider using a
  ~/bob/roadmap.base file (with a badge and count at the top of the ~/bob/dash.md file
  maybe?) instead of a ~/bob/roadmap.md file (maybe using dataview properties on
  Obsidian tasks to specify which of the "Now", "Next", or "Later" roadmap sections they
  should be rendered in?).
- It did not consider what types of automations we should implement. For example, we
  should consider adding/modifying Obsidian keymaps, adding new syntax for the
  `bob capture` command and its corresponding bob-mac-capture app, and whether or not
  the `bob task-status-hooks` command could be used to automate cleanup and/or make it
  clearer in Obsidian when I am violating one of the rules of my new process.
- Think hard about what other short-comings with the previous research you can address.

You are the lead researcher: 5 independent researchers have reported on the request
below, and you will add your own research and merge every perspective into one
consolidated report.

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

The researchers' registered reports:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

Month directory (create it if missing):

$(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)

Steps:

1. From the registered reports above, identify exactly one report per expected suffix
   in cdx, cld, grk, mus, gem, belonging to this
   dispatch's `research.p.cdx`, `research.p.cld`, `research.p.grk`, `research.p.mus`, `research.p.gem` dependencies, matching by `wait_name` and the canonical research
   label's existing `__<suffix>.md` suffix. Never reassign suffixes from list order.
   Open the research repo with `/sase_repo`, then read each report through its canonical
   research reference (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has
   moved) using `sase artifact read`. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. If the
   records above do not identify exactly one report per expected suffix, stop and report
   the missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing.
2. Research the request yourself, prioritizing gaps, weak evidence, and disagreements
   between the reports.
3. Pick a descriptive stem `<name>` that collides with nothing in the month directory
   (do NOT end the name with `_consolidated` or `_<YYYYmmdd>` or anything similar unless
   it relates to the research topic), create `<month-dir>/<name>/`, and move each report
   inside it as `<name>__<suffix>.md`, preserving its existing suffix. Each report's
   `source_path` is provenance for where it lives in your own opened research checkout;
   resolve its canonical repo-relative path there before moving it. Never modify the
   other agents' checkouts or the stored snapshot recorded at `ref` — only the copy in
   your own checkout moves. Preserve every file and never overwrite: on any collision,
   pick a different stem first.
4. Write the consolidated report to `<name>/<name>.md`: merge the strongest findings
   from every report above and your own research, resolve conflicts, cut duplication,
   and add missing critical context without unnecessary length.
