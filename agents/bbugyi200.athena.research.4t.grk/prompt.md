You are researcher grk in a 4-researcher swarm.
The other researchers, `research.4t.cdx`, `research.4t.cld`, `research.4t.gem`, are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__cld.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report will end in `__grk.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

We currently label every pomodoro with a theme and use these themes to aggregate
statistics in the ~/bob/dash_stats.md file. I would like to start automatically labeling
pomodoros by the corresponding projects and/or areas of the task links contained in
them.

- As a part of this change, we should start aggregating the stats shown in the
  ~/bob/dash_stats.md file by area and project when possible.
- We will need the ability to exclude sub-projects of some projects from being
  aggregated and/or used to label pomodoros directly. Instead, task links to tasks in
  these sub-projects should be treated as if (when labeling pomodoro and aggregating
  stats) they pointed to tasks in the parent project that configured this. We should
  configure the ~/bob/sase.md project note to use this functionality.
- I'm not sure how/when/what to label pomodoros, so you should think hard about this.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution. #research(suffix=grk)
