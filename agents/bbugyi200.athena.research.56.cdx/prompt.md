You are researcher cdx in a 5-researcher swarm.
The other researchers, `research.56.cld`, `research.56.grk`, `research.56.mus`, `research.56.gem`, are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named reports ending in `__cld.md` and `__grk.md` and `__mus.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report will end in `__cdx.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

When the `bob ref scan` command is run on my macbook, it sometimes updates the `status:`
field of some ref PDF markers. This is normally fine, but when I have one of those PDFs
opened in the Highlights app, I trigger a conflict if I try to leave an annotation on
that PDF. I then need to revert that annotation (and any others I've made before
attempting to save) and re-apply it. I think we can probably fix this by having the
`bob ref scan` command automatically close the Highlights app tab corresponding with
that PDF and then re-open that PDF in the Highlights app, right?

- To make this change safer, we should also attempt to save any unsaved annotations in
  the Highlights app (pressing `<cmd+s>` works in the app but I'm not sure if there is a
  better way to automate this).
- Make sure that we make it clear to the user somehow when we do this (e.g. by sending a
  mac notification).

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution. #research(suffix=cdx)
