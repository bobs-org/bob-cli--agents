#gh:gh_bobs-org__bob-cli I would like to add record notes (like those stored in the ~/bob/eat/
directory) to the network of area note files (i.e. give each record a root parent). Can
you help me implement this?

- The idea is that everything I could possibly want to track should be (and is
  conceptually) linked to an area of responsibility in my life.
- For example, the ~/bob/eat.md file should have `[[body]]` as its parent and the
  ~/bob/podcast.md file should have `[[dev]]` as its parent.
- Files like ~/bob/eat.md and ~/bob/podcast.md (which should be renamed to
  ~/bob/podcasts.md) should have a new "album" value for their `type` frontmatter field.
  - The record types that are configured in a configuration file currently should have
    their definitions migrated to the frontmatter of these "album" files.
  - These album files should be "dezorged" appropriately, if necessary (see how we
    recently did this for the ~/bob/job.md file for context).
  - We should render an excellent summary of records that exist for the given album in
    the album note file. Think hard about what form this should take.
  - We should also render an excellent new H2 section in the area / project note that
    the album note specifies as its parent. Think hard about what contents would be most
    useful and appropriate for this section.
- As a part of this change, we should add excellent new glossary terms for "album note"
  and "record note".
- Review the album_and_record_notes.md file in the research sidecar repo for context and inspiration
  before planning. I agree with all of the requirements recommended in that research
  file (but keep in mind that you are responsible for planning and splitting up this
  work appropriately).
