You are researcher mus in a 5-researcher swarm.
The other researchers, `research.3f.cdx`, `research.3f.cld`, `research.3f.grk`, `research.3f.gem`, are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__cld.md` and `__grk.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report will end in `__mus.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I would like to add support for a new `< @foo+f` capture syntax that complements the
existing `> @foo+f` capture syntax.

- This syntax should only be valid in a context that would create a new task.
- When this syntax is used, the task targeted with `@foo+f` (i.e. the `^f` task in the
  ~/bob/foo.md file in this example) will be merged into the newly created task using
  the existing "merged into" task relation label.
- We should be able to specify multiple tasks after the `<` to merge all of those tasks
  into the newly created task.
- For example, the `Some great new task! @foo^great < @foo+f @bar+b` would merge the
  `^b` task in the ~/bob/bar.md file and the `^f` task in the ~/bob/foo.md file into the
  newly created `^great` task (in the ~/bob/foo.md file) by linking them to `^great`
  using the "merged into" task relation label.
- Make sure this syntax supports an excellent and useful (but concise) preview in the
  bob-mac-capture app.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution. #research(suffix=mus)
