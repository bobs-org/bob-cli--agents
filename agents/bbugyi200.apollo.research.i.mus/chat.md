You are researcher mus in a 5-researcher swarm.
The other researchers, `research.i.cdx`, `research.i.cld`, `research.i.grk`, `research.i.gem`, are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__cld.md` and `__grk.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report will end in `__mus.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I want to
implement a new `bob gkeep` command.

- This command will have a sub-command that migrates all of my current Google Keep inbox
  items (which I can see by going to https://keep.google.com/#home) to Obsidian tasks in
  the ~/bob/gkeep_inbox.md file.
- These Google Keep items should be archived in Google Keep once we are sure the
  migration was successful.
- This command should also have a sub-command that allows me to list all items in my
  Google Keep and/or Obsidian tasks in the ~/bob/gkeep_inbox.md file.
- I want you to lead the design on this one. Make sure you design this feature so it is intuitive, reliable, and (last but not least) beautiful!

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution. 
Write this research to a new markdown file under the $(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)/ directory.
Choose a descriptive filename stem yourself, but the filename MUST end with the
`__mus` suffix, i.e. `<stem>__mus.md` (double underscore before the
suffix). Create the report without overwrite: if the exact file already exists, pick a
different stem instead of replacing it.


After the write succeeds, register the report as a durable snapshot:

sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

Use the report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the research repo root
(for example `research:202609/topic__a.md`), including any subdirectory the steps above
put it in. Do not derive the label from the current month, the clock, or a guessed name.
Do not pass `--move`; the source stays in the research repo for later reorganization. If
registration itself fails, report that failure — do not report the research task as
fully complete.

## Response

Research complete. Report written to `sase/repos/research/202609/bob_gkeep_command__mus.md` and registered as durable snapshot `file:explicit:a418e89f1be341d821c95507` (`research:202609/bob_gkeep_command__mus.md`).

Headline findings: the official Keep API is Workspace-only so it's a dead end for a personal inbox; live list + archive-back requires the unofficial `gkeepapi` protocol with fragile token auth; Takeout JSON is the stable sanctioned path but one-way. Recommended: `bob gkeep` with `list` / `migrate` / `import` / `doctor` subcommands, Takeout-first delivery, live sync as an isolated opt-in helper, and archive strictly behind re-parse verification plus a state-dir manifest.
