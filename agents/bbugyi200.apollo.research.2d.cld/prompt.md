You are researcher cld in a 5-researcher swarm.
The other researchers, `research.2d.cdx`, `research.2d.grk`, `research.2d.mus`, `research.2d.gem`, are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__grk.md` and `__mus.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report will end in `__cld.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I would like to add support for grouping one or more annotations under another
annotation (a "section annotation") when rendering ref notes from ref PDF annotations
(made using the Highlights app).

- A section annotation should be of the form `# <name>`, with an optional description
  after a blank line.
- Any highlight note / underline note / standalone note that then contains `@<name>`
  should be rendered under a nice, visually appealing section of some sort. Think hard
  about the best way to persist and render this grouping.
- This grouping should be plesent to view in Obsidian and in the bob-mac-capture app's
  ref panel (and anywhere else we view ref notes).

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution. #research(suffix=cld)
