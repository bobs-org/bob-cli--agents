think we may have made a mistake adding the `#now` tag.

- Part of the reason it was deemed necessary is because we were preserving the behavior
  of the `bob task-status-hooks` command that keeps WIP/Next Obsidian task statuses in
  sync with whether or not the task has a task link in the current pomodoro.
- We can remove that, but that would leave one unfilled need: I need a way to query for
  all tasks associated with task links in today's daily file.
- We can fill this need, however, using either a file path filter in the query or by
  using some kind of `#today` tag that the `bob task-status-hooks` command starts
  managing instead of WIP/Next statuses.
- We would then replace the Now/WIP/Next section queries in the ~/bob/dash.md file with
  Today/Pending/Next queries that must be mutually exclusive (i.e. a task can only be
  shown in one of these sections).
- Then, as a part of my daily morning GTD review, I can review all Pending/Next tasks
  first to pull in tasks for today and then, if I don't have enough work for the day,
  pull from the Ready section's tasks.
- This means that what was tracked using `#now` would now start being tracked by the
  Next status. The only thing I think I lose here is the ability to have a task link
  that is not tagged with `#now` (since every task link is either WIP/Pending or--by
  default--Next). That's fine though since I don't really need that I don't think.
- It's important that Pending/WIP tasks not have their statuses wiped by the
  `bob task-status-hooks` command either since that will allow me to remove the
  corresponding task link when I have a task that is in-progress, likely to be done the
  next time I look at it, but I won't be able to look at it for a while (because a swarm
  of agents will take a few hours to implement it, for example--this way I won't forget
  to review this work, since it will be in the Pending section of the ~/bob/dash.md
  file, but it also won't be in my face for the time being, since I can remove it from
  my daily file).

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.]]) %id:research.u.final %m:@xlarge

You are the lead researcher: 5 independent researchers have reported on the request
below, and you will add your own research and merge every perspective into one
consolidated report.

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

The researchers' registered reports:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

Month directory (create it if missing):

$(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)

Steps:

1. From the registered reports above, identify exactly one report per expected suffix
   in cdx, cld, grk, mus, gem, belonging to this
   dispatch's `research.u.cdx`, `research.u.cld`, `research.u.grk`, `research.u.mus`, `research.u.gem` dependencies, matching by `wait_name` and the canonical research
   label's existing `__<suffix>.md` suffix. Never reassign suffixes from list order.
   Open the research repo with `/sase_repo`, then read each report through its canonical
   research reference (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has
   moved) using `sase artifact read`. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. If the
   records above do not identify exactly one report per expected suffix, stop and report
   the missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing.
2. Research the request yourself, prioritizing gaps, weak evidence, and disagreements
   between the reports.
3. Pick a descriptive stem `<name>` that collides with nothing in the month directory
   (do NOT end the name with `_consolidated` or `_<YYYYmmdd>` or anything similar unless
   it relates to the research topic), create `<month-dir>/<name>/`, and move each report
   inside it as `<name>__<suffix>.md`, preserving its existing suffix. Each report's
   `source_path` is provenance for where it lives in your own opened research checkout;
   resolve its canonical repo-relative path there before moving it. Never modify the
   other agents' checkouts or the stored snapshot recorded at `ref` — only the copy in
   your own checkout moves. Preserve every file and never overwrite: on any collision,
   pick a different stem first.
4. Write the consolidated report to `<name>/<name>__final.md`: merge the strongest findings
   from every report above and your own research, resolve conflicts, cut duplication,
   and add missing critical context without unnecessary length.

   Do not create `<name>/<name>.md`, not even as a placeholder, because the linker
   agent `research.u.linker` publishes it from your report.

5. After the write succeeds, register the consolidated report as a durable snapshot so
   the linker agent, `research.u.linker`, can find it:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the consolidated report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the
   research repo root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>__final.md`. Register
   only the consolidated report, and do not pass `--move`. If registration fails,
   report that failure; do not report the task as fully complete.
