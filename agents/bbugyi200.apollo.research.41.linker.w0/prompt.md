#gh:gh_bobs-org__bob-cli I want to make the stats strips shown in period notes look much nicer. Can you
help me implement this?

- For one, we should only use task types in the current charts to reduce clutter.
- We should show root parents in a separate chart.
- We should only show the top N root parents (where N is configurable--set this field to
  5 in my chezmoi repo) in this new chart.
- We should be able to toggle between showing root parents only, task types only, and
  both (like we can in the day strip).
- See the ~/tmp/screenshots/20261110_095225.png screenshot for an example of what a
  weekly period note looks like now (you should also improve the other period note
  types).
- Review the period_strip_two_chart_redesign.md file in the research sidecar repo for context and inspiration
  before planning. I agree with all of the requirements recommended in that research
  file (but keep in mind that you are responsible for planning and splitting up this
  work appropriately).
