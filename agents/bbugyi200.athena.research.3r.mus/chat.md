You are researcher mus in a 5-researcher swarm.
The other researchers, `research.3r.cdx`, `research.3r.cld`, `research.3r.grk`, `research.3r.gem`, are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__cld.md` and `__grk.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report will end in `__mus.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I would like to add a new `--listen` option to the `bob highlights create` command that
uses the `sase-listen render <target> -e full` command (see the sase-org/sase-listen
repo on GitHub) to create a new podcast episode (that gets published to a feed that I
subscribe to from the AntennaPod app on my phone) alongside the PDF and ref note that is
linked to from the PDF we generate.

- The goal of this change is to make sure that I am always tracking articles / papers
  that I listen to via AI audio transcriptions in my Obsidian ref note system.
- We should not depend directly on the `sase-listen` command, but should instead make
  this configurable (make the appropriate changes to my bob config, which is defined in
  my chezmoi repo).
- Also, as a part of this change, i want to make sure that the `bob highlights create`
  command supports the same values for `<target>` that the `sase-listen render` command
  does. Namely, it should support URLs that point to PDFs. It should also have the same
  special support for arxiv that sase-listen does. When `<target>` points to a PDF, we
  obviously don't need to create a new PDF (just use that one), but make sure to add the
  appropriate Highlghts note and store it in the proper location still.
- The `sase-listen render` command's output should be shown in full if it is run by the
  `bob highlghts create` command.
- I want you to lead the design on this one. Make sure you design this feature so it is intuitive, reliable, and (last but not least) beautiful!

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution. 
Write this research to a new markdown file under the $(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)/ directory.
Choose a descriptive filename stem yourself, but the filename MUST end with the
`__mus` suffix, i.e. `<stem>__mus.md` (double underscore before the
suffix). Create the report without overwrite: if the exact file already exists, pick a
different stem instead of replacing it.


After the write succeeds, register the report as a durable snapshot:

sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

Use the report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the research repo root
(for example `research:202609/topic__a.md`), including any subdirectory the steps above
put it in. Do not derive the label from the current month, the clock, or a guessed name.
Do not pass `--move`; the source stays in the research repo for later reorganization. If
registration itself fails, report that failure — do not report the research task as
fully complete.

## Response

Research complete. Report written to `sase/repos/research/202610/highlights_create_listen_option__mus.md` and registered as `file:explicit:94ee8a6c3174728dc7430be4`.

Top finding: the plan is sound but has one blocking gap — bare `sase-listen render -e full` does **not** publish (auto-publish defaults off), so without `--publish` nothing reaches AntennaPod. The report recommends `--listen/-L` defaulting to publish, a configurable `highlights.listen_command` (+ edition/publish keys in chezmoi), inherited-stdio render with a free `--dry-run --json` pre-flight for cost visibility, and scoping phase 1 to Markdown sources while routing URL/PDF/arXiv intake through the existing `clip` validation/dedupe path instead of a second fetcher.

Declaration submitted for `sdd:research` (commit of `highlights_create_listen_option__mus.md`).
