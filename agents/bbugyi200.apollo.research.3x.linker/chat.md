You are the linker agent for a research swarm. The lead researcher,
`research.3x.final`, has written a consolidated report on the request below. Your job
is to publish that report as the canonical `<name>.md`: the file readers open, and the
one SASE renders into a Highlights PDF. You are an editor, not a researcher. The new
file must carry exactly the lead's meaning and intent. Do not do research of your own:
add no new claims or sources, settle no open questions, and neither soften nor
strengthen the conclusions or the recommendation. If the lead seems wrong, leave it as
written. The only prose you write yourself is the short research-query summary of the
request that opens the file (step 3). The only other content you
add is the image agent's diagrams and captions, copied verbatim, plus a figure anchor
and one short reference sentence for each diagram you place (step 3).

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

Research request (context only; do not research it, but summarize it as the file's
research query in step 3):

I would like to add a new "notebook" Obsidian note file type (i.e. supported value for
the `type` frontmatter field).

- Notebooks will only contain note bullets (optionally organized into H2 sections) and
  will be a useful way to organize notes by giving us a way to group related notes
  without creating a new area note or project note. It will likely be useful at some
  point, for example, to have the ability to factor a large H2 section in an area note /
  project note out into its own child notebook.
- These files should always be children of (i.e. point to via their `parent` frontmatter
  field) an area note, project note, or another notebook.
- We should add an excellent new "notebook" glossary term to describe this concept.
- We should render an excellent, visually appealing section in the root parent of
  notebooks (for any root parent that has notebook children or has non-root chilren that
  do, recursively) that links to each notebook and includes a good summary of each
  notebook (maybe via a required notebook frontmatter field?).
- Capture Syntax
  - We should be able to create a new notebook using the `@foo^bar@` project capture
    syntax with the `%n` directive (which will have two related purposes now--notes and
    notebooks).
  - We should be able to add notes to existing notebooks or notebook H2 sections using
    the `@@foo` or `@@foo#bar` syntaxes, respectively, which would add a new note the
    the ~/bob/foo.md notebook file either at the top-level (for `@@foo`) or in the "Bar"
    H2 section (for `@@foo#bar`).
  - We should also support the `@@foo+baz` syntax to add a sub-bullet to the note bullet
    with the `^baz` block ID in the ~/bob/foo.md file.
  - Make sure that we support assigning block IDs to captured notes using the
    `@@foo^some-id` syntax as well (with a block ID prompt that pre-fills a suggested
    block ID).
  - Make sure all single character capture aliases (`.` to `@`, `.` to `^`, and `/` to
    `#`, for example) work properly with this new syntax.
- You should dig through my Obsidian vault (i.e. the ~/bob/ directory) in search of the
  most useful candidate notebooks. Search for any notes in my vault that contain
  relevant information (I think I have a lot of these) but are not currently linked into
  my Obsidian system properly (live in a file without a parent, for example). The
  selected notes should be migrated, as a part of this change, to my first new
  notebooks.
- I want you to lead the design on this one. Make sure you design this feature so it is intuitive, reliable, and (last but not least) beautiful!

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.

The lead researcher's registered report:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

The image agent's registered images:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "image" %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} vcs_relpath={{ a.vcs_relpath }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}


The image agent's diagram proposals:

{% if agents is defined %}{% for key, outputs in agents.items() if outputs.diagrams is defined %}
- agent={{ key }} diagrams={{ outputs.diagrams }}
{% endfor %}{% endif %}
{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.label and a.label.startswith("diagrams:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}


Steps:

1. **Identify the source.** From the registered reports above, find exactly one entry
   with `wait_name` `research.3x.final` whose label has the form
   `research:<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>__final.md`. If there is not exactly one such entry,
   stop and report the missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing. Open the research
   repo with `/sase_repo`, then read the report through its canonical research reference
   (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has moved) using
   `sase artifact read`. Take `<YYYYMM>/<name>/` from the label, never from the current
   date. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. Never modify, move, or delete
   `<name>__final.md` or the drafts or `<name>.diagrams.md`.
   Read the `diagrams` variable of `research.3x.image`. Only when its `status` is
   `ready`, take exactly one listed `diagrams:` entry from `wait_name`
   `research.3x.image` whose label is
   `diagrams:<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>.diagrams.md` for the lead's own
   `<YYYYMM>/<name>/`. Read it with `sase artifact read`, and confirm its `source`
   equals the lead's label. Publish with no proposed diagrams, and say why in the
   final response, if the status is `none` or `failed`, the variable is missing, the
   manifest entry is missing or ambiguous, or the source does not match. Diagram
   problems never stop publication. The manifest's `question` and `review` are the
   image agent's audit notes: never copy them into the report.

2. **Inventory what must survive.** Before writing, list every finding, recommendation,
   caveat, open question, confidence statement, number, date, version, code block,
   table, and link in the
   lead's report. For each manifest diagram, record its ID against
   the one lead block (paragraph or list item) that contains its `anchor`. Mark a
   diagram whose anchor matches zero or several blocks as omitted. Mark every diagram after the fifth in manifest order as omitted (over the cap).
3. **Restructure** the lead's report into a well-thought-out organization:
   - Keep the frontmatter, updating `updated_time` if present.
   - **Open the file in this exact order**, with nothing else between these parts: the frontmatter (if any), one `#` title, the research query, the infographic, and then the bottom-line section.
   - **Research query.** Directly below the title, add one blockquote that summarizes
     the research request above in one to three sentences, for example
     `> **Research query:** <summary>`. Phrase it as the question or task being
     answered, in the requester's own terms: keep the questions, named subjects, and
     explicit scope or constraints; drop instructions aimed at agents, such as output
     paths, macro or directive syntax, and formatting requests. Summarize what was
     asked, not material the request quotes or attaches. Use a request that is already
     one short sentence verbatim. Never fold findings, answers, or scope the request
     does not state into it. It is not a heading, so it gets no section number and no
     TOC entry.
   - **Embed the infographic** exactly once, directly above the bottom-line section:
     after the research query and before that section's `##` heading, never further
     down. Use a relative link with descriptive alt text, for example
     `![<alt text>](<name>_infographic.png)`. Locate it by the
     `<name>_infographic.png` convention or the image entries above. Embed only a file
     you have confirmed exists beside the report in your research checkout. If the
     image agent completed without producing one, publish without it (the research query then sits directly above the bottom-line section) and say so in the final
     response.
   - **Bottom-line section.** The first `##` section is `## Bottom line` (or
     `## Overview` when the report surveys options rather than giving one answer) and
     gives the answer first.
   - Below it, `##` and `###` sections ordered by the questions a reader will ask, with
     duplicated passages merged.
   - **Never number headings.** The PDF renderer runs pandoc with `--number-sections`,
     so hand-numbered headings render doubly numbered.
   - **No table of contents and no block of jump links.** The PDF already gets a TOC.
   - Keep the lead's wording where it works. Never drop a claim, caveat, or source to
     save space. If the lead's report restates the question or lists its inputs, keep
     those details in a later section; the research query summarizes the request but
     does not replace them.
   - **Place proposed diagrams.** After restructuring, insert each fence byte-for-byte
     directly after the block that now carries the tagged content, even if that content
     was reordered or merged. Only that figure's
     reference sentence may sit between the block and its fence. Follow the fence with
     the caption as one italic line, with blank lines around both, and wrap the fence
     and caption in the figure anchor described below. Then check that the surrounding
     final text still states the `illustrates` point and that no box or edge contradicts
     it. Omit the diagram otherwise. Never place a diagram in the fixed opening
     sequence, directly under a heading, inside a list or blockquote (put it after the
     whole list), or in an appendix; bottom-line content goes at the end of that
     section; two diagrams on one block go in manifest order. Never edit, redraw,
     merge, or invent a diagram. A private scratch marker such as `<!-- D:<id> -->` may
     be used in the working draft but must be gone before writing.
   - **Anchor every placed figure.** Wrap each placed fence and its caption, and
     nothing else, in `<div id="figure-<id>">` and `</div>`, using its manifest `## <id>`.
     Convert the ID to lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens, replacing each run of
     other characters with one hyphen. Keep the resulting ID unique in the file; if it
     matches a heading anchor or another figure ID, append `-2`, `-3`, and so on. Leave
     a blank line after the opening tag and before the closing tag so GitHub and pandoc
     parse the fence and caption as Markdown. The wrapper is the figure's link target
     on both reading surfaces: GitHub keeps its ID for jumps, and the Highlights PDF
     gives it return links. Use this shape:

     ````markdown
     <div id="figure-publication-order">

     <the manifest's mermaid fence, byte-for-byte>

     _The linker publishes once, after every companion finishes._

     </div>
     ````

     Never put an ID or attribute on the fence itself, and never substitute an `<a>`
     anchor or a heading. This wrapper and the listen card are the only HTML blocks you
     write.
   - **Reference every placed figure.** Write exactly one short sentence per placed
     figure and link it with `[<link text>](#figure-<id>)`, using the final unique ID,
     so every published figure is referenced. Tell the reader what the figure makes
     visible that the prose alone does not, such as a path, order, branch, or handoff.
     Build the sentence from the manifest's `illustrates` point, phrased in the
     surrounding text's terms. Never write a bare pointer such as "See the diagram below."
     The sentence is a pointer, not a finding: add no claim, number, actor,
     step, or causal link that `illustrates` and the surrounding final text do not
     already state; keep conditional wording conditional and proposed designs distinct
     from implemented ones. Do not repeat the caption word for word. Name the figure in
     the link text, for example `the publication-order diagram`.
     Never use "here", "this", or a figure number in the link text. Keep it to about
     12 to 30 words of plain prose. It is
     not italic, a heading, or a list item, and never goes inside the figure's `<div>`,
     its caption, or a blockquote. When the figure directly follows the paragraph that
     carries its anchor, make the reference sentence end that paragraph. Otherwise,
     give it its own short paragraph directly above the figure's `<div>`; this happens
     when the anchor sits in a list (so the figure follows the whole list) or when the
     figure closes the bottom-line section. Two figures after one block get one sentence
     each, in manifest order. If you omit a figure, delete its sentence too; no link may
     point to an unpublished figure. For example: `… so the link must be in the linker's first commit. [The publication-order diagram](#figure-publication-order) traces why the linker waits for every companion agent: the PDF hook fires only once, on the ADD of name.md.`
4. **Validate every link carried over.**
   - Relative links resolve from `<YYYYMM>/<name>/`, and in-document anchors resolve
     against the final headings and figure anchors. Both are hard requirements.
   - Check external URLs with `curl -fsSL -o /dev/null --max-time 20 <url>`, retrying
     a transient failure once. Treat 401, 403, 429, and timeouts as _unverified_ and
     keep those links.
   - Verify repository-file links through a `/sase_repo` checkout, not by fetching
     github.com.
   - Repair a link only when the right target is certain: a followed redirect, a moved
     file, an obvious typo, or a renamed heading. For an unrepairable link, keep its
     text, drop the dead URL, and list it in the final response. **Never search for a
     replacement source.**

5. **Add in-document links** so readers can jump between parts of the file. Add them
   inline and sparingly: from summary points to the sections that back them, from "see
   above" or "see below" phrases, and from mentions of a named option, phase, or
   finding to where it is discussed. Do not link every mention.
   - Every heading used as a link target must start with a letter, contain only
     letters, digits, spaces, and hyphens, and be unique. Its anchor is then the
     lowercased heading with spaces replaced by hyphens, for example
     `[the bottom line](#bottom-line)`. pandoc (the PDF) and GitHub then agree.
   - Move emoji, version numbers, and code out of such headings, into the section's
     first line.
   - When `pandoc` is available, confirm anchors with `pandoc <file> -t html`.
   - A summary point that discusses a figure's content may also link sparingly to its
     `figure-<id>` anchor. Always link a figure through that anchor, never through a
     nearby heading.

6. **Re-check against the step-2 inventory** and restore anything missing or changed.
   Every URL in `<name>__final.md` must appear in the new file unless it was listed as
   unrepairable. Then confirm the file opens in the step-3 order: title, research query, infographic, bottom-line section.
   Confirm every cell of every table in the lead's report appears in the new file. Every Mermaid diagram from the lead's report is still present. Every manifest diagram appears exactly once, byte-identical,
   or is named as omitted. Every accepted diagram sits inside exactly one figure-anchor
   `<div>` holding only its fence and caption, and its reference sentence links to it:
   `grep -c '^<div id="figure-' <file>` equals the number of accepted diagrams; every
   `(#figure-` link names an ID that exists in the file; and `pandoc <file> -t html`
   shows each `id="figure-<id>"`. The published mermaid fence count equals the
   lead's count plus the number of accepted proposed diagrams. In the final response, list accepted diagram IDs with their
   `figure-<id>` anchors and omitted IDs with reasons. Never write "diagrams pending".

7. **Write** `<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>.md` without overwrite. On a collision, stop and
   report it.

8. **Register** it as a durable snapshot:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the research repo
   root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>.md`. Use no `--move`. If
   registration fails, report it and do not claim full completion.

## Response

Reading the lead's report and checking whether its two registrations are the same file.

The manifest matches the lead's label and has one diagram. Now reading the full report.

The report has one Mermaid figure, no URLs or file links, and §-number cross-references that need converting to heading links. Next I'll check the infographic so I can write its alt text.

I have everything I need. I'm writing `bob_notebooks.md` now, with a placeholder where the diagram goes; a script will then copy the manifest fence in byte-for-byte.

Now I'll swap in the manifest fence byte-for-byte and run the inventory and link checks.

Every missing line is an intended change (headings, § refs, or rewrapped lines with links). A word-level check of the rewrapped paragraphs:

Only headings and the § cross-references differ. Next: table cells, anchors, and the pandoc render.

All 355 table cells and every anchor check out. A last look at the opening order and the figure block:

All checks pass, and the lead's files are untouched. Registering the snapshot:

Registered. Now I'll finish through the final declaration.

I've published the lead's report as `202611/bob_notebooks/bob_notebooks.md` and registered it as `research:202611/bob_notebooks/bob_notebooks.md` (`file:explicit:0d4c0f0b9ff95d6a181ea8a5`). The commit to the research repo is declared and runs after this turn ends.

**Which source I used.** The lead registered `research:202611/bob_notebooks/bob_notebooks__final.md` twice, both with the same label and source path. The current canonical file is identical to the later registration (`file:explicit:b25b767069a2c080298bf2cf`). That is also the version the diagram manifest was drawn from. The earlier registration is an older draft of the same file: it lacks the bob-cli-j7/j3 task references and the note on coordinating with the bob-cli-j6 epic. So I treated it as one source. I did not modify the lead's report, the drafts, or the diagram manifest.

**Layout.**
- **Opening:** the title, then a three-sentence research query, the infographic (`bob_notebooks_infographic.png`, confirmed beside the report), and `## Bottom line`.
- **Section order:** whether this is a good idea → requirement adjustments → recommended design → vault migration (waves 1–3, not notebooks, procedure) → phasing and risks → open questions → evidence and resolved disagreements → recommended solution, which still ends the report as the request asked.
- **Moved content:** the lead's header lines (who wrote it, pinned sources, the question) are now under "Sources and method", inside the evidence section.
- **Headings:** none are numbered. "Phasing, risks, and open questions" is now two sections, and labels like "(called out)" and "(22 files, 9 roots)" became link-safe headings or moved to each section's first line.
- **Section references:** the lead's `§5.2`, `§6` and `§5.5` pointers would no longer match the PDF's automatic numbering. I replaced them with links to the matching headings (Capture, Vault migration, Glossary term).
- **Links:** I added a few in-document links, and every one resolves against pandoc's heading IDs.

**Diagrams.**
- **Accepted:** `capture-batch-consistency` → `#figure-capture-batch-consistency`. It sits after the "Parse and preview" list in the Capture section, byte-identical to the manifest, with its caption and one reference sentence.
- **Omitted:** none; the manifest proposed only this one.
- **Lead's own diagram:** the catalog-ownership flowchart ("Figure 1") is unchanged, so the file now has two Mermaid diagrams.

**Checks.** All 355 table cells survive. Every lead paragraph survives once the new links are stripped, apart from the headings and `§` pointers changed on purpose. The lead's report has no external URLs or file links, so nothing was unrepairable.
