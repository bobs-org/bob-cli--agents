#gh:gh_bobs-org__bob-cli I would like to improve the "bank badge" that we currently show in the day
strip, which shows incoming/outgoing bank transactions made that day. Can you help me
implement this?

- As a part of this change, we should add a new glossary term for "bank badge".
- We should start only showing the in/out parts of this badge when the corresponding
  value is >$0.00. If neither incoming transactions nor outgoing transactions meet this
  criteria (i.e. they are both $0.00), the badge should not be shown.
- We should start coloring the badge based on the in/out values. Think hard about which
  colors are appropriate to use when.
- We should start rendering a bank badge on all period notes which show aggregated
  transactions for that period. In other words, a bank badge should be rendered by every
  stats strip.
- Review the bank_badge_strip_family.md file in the research sidecar repo for context
  and inspiration before planning. I agree with all of the requirements recommended in
  that research file (but keep in mind that you are responsible for planning and
  splitting up this work appropriately).
