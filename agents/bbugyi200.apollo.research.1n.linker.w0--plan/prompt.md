#gh:gh_bobs-org__bob-cli We recently added support to the `bob capture` command and the corresponding
bob-mac-capture app for capture templates (see the bob-cli-7w epic bead for context).
Can you now help me add support for persisting templates to disk automatically when they
are used?

- We should then allow the user to access and modify the templates that have been saved
  in the bob-mac-capture app.
- This should work in a similar way to the capture stash.
  - We should use a new `<ctrl+t>` keymap that allows the user to view/modify saved
    templates.
  - Just like with the stash, we should pop a template when it is selected (it will just
    get re-added when the capture is submitted if the template is used).
- Review the capture_template_shelf.md file in the research sidecar repo for context and inspiration
  before planning. I agree with all of the requirements recommended in that research
  file (but keep in mind that you are responsible for planning and splitting up this
  work appropriately).
