You are researcher mus in a 5-researcher swarm.
The other researchers, `research.j.cdx`, `research.j.cld`, `research.j.grk`, `research.j.gem`, are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__cld.md` and `__grk.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report will end in `__mus.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I want to
implement a new `bob randomize` command.

- This command would be used to re-schedule all of the currently due scheduled and
  prioritized Obsidian tasks (i.e. tasks that have a `scheduled` property equal to a
  date of today or earlier and have a `priority` property) using a random date.
- I use the `priority` field to mark lower priority (<P0) tasks. The goal of this change
  is to allow me to quickly re-schedule all of these lower priority tasks using random
  dates at once. This will be useful, for example, when I've gone several days/weeks
  without reviewing my tasks and need to focus all of my attention on getting P0 tasks
  done / organized.
- Each task's date should be randomized separately using the range of dates that is
  configured in the ~/.config/bob/config.yml file (based on the priority of that task).
- If possible, we should try to commit the file changes made by this command using a
  single commit. Make sure that our single commit doesn't cause issues with / conflict
  with the `bob vault-sync` command.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution. 
Write this research to a new markdown file under the $(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)/ directory.
Choose a descriptive filename stem yourself, but the filename MUST end with the
`__mus` suffix, i.e. `<stem>__mus.md` (double underscore before the
suffix). Create the report without overwrite: if the exact file already exists, pick a
different stem instead of replacing it.


After the write succeeds, register the report as a durable snapshot:

sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

Use the report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the research repo root
(for example `research:202609/topic__a.md`), including any subdirectory the steps above
put it in. Do not derive the label from the current month, the clock, or a guessed name.
Do not pass `--move`; the source stays in the research repo for later reorganization. If
registration itself fails, report that failure — do not report the research task as
fully complete.

## Response

Done. Research complete and committed.

- Report: `202609/bob_randomize_command__mus.md` in the research repo (independent `__mus` assessment, no peer material consulted).
- Registered as durable snapshot: `research:202609/bob_randomize_command__mus.md` (artifact `file:explicit:05c4544b3ddf590755e6a27d`).
- Recommendation: native `bob randomize` reusing `config.rs` priority windows and `roll_offset`, narrow eligibility (open task, exactly one valid `scheduled <= today`, recognized priority value, skip P0/`^prj`/frontmatter), in-place field rewrite with schedule-log entry, shared `ob` lock, one path-scoped commit with no push (publish via `vault-sync`), plus `--dry-run`/`--seed`/`--format json`.
- Final declaration accepted for the research repo commit.
